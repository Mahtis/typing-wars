# Typing wars

**The ultimate game to prove your typing skills and assert your dominance!**

The game is still very much under development and is missing many critical features, so don't whine and complain.

If you want to try it, first run `npm install` and then run `npm start`. Then open your chrome browser (don't know if any other works, don't care) and go to `localhost:1234/room/1`. Then open a **second, separate browser session** (in incognito mode) and go to the same address. Now when you type the first word on the list shown to you and press `space` or `enter`, it should start dropping in the other browser. You can also watch it drop in the smaller grid on the right side. The dropping words can be moved left or right, rotated between horizontal and vertical, and dropped down. Not much else happening at the moment. The game will not end or count points or anything fancy like that. Shut up.

If you want to develop the game, you can check the cool project with some todo items. Some parts are decently tested, so run `npm test` and start coding. Other parts that are not tested, should be, so run `npm test` and start coding.
